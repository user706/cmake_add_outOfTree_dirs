On visual studio 2019 preview, when opening the toplevel CMakeLists.txt and quickly switching between 
x86-Debug, x86-Release, x86-Debug, x86-Release, x86-Debug, x86-Release, ...

I get hanging behaviour

The output is stuck on this:

```
1> CMake generation started.
1> CMake generation finished.
1> CMake generation canceled.
```
